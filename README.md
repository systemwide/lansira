Create custom sets of tabs.

For alpha/beta version installation please see: https://blog.hunter.io/install-chrome-extension-manually/ - a good 
concise guide to manually loading the extension as either an "unpacked extension" - if you download as a zip file and unzip, 
or as a .crx file.

A new set will be created from all the tabs in the currently active window. Suggested usage is:
1. To create a new set, open a new window. (This is mainly to avoid creating sets with your pinned tabs in them).
2. In that new window, open the tabs you want included in your new set.
3. Click the extension icon in the top right. 
4. Then click "More Options". 
5. Type a name for your set into the text input field.
6. Either hit Enter/Return, or click the green "Add/Edit Sets" button.
7. If you want to delete sets, click "More Options"
8. Then check the box associated with the sets you want to delete.
9. The click the maroon "Delete Selected Sets" button.

To open a set of tabs, click the extension icon in the top right, then just click on the appropriate button.
If you have a set with a lot of tabs, it might be better to start with a new window to avoid clutter.
The sets shown initially are defaults, which will be re-loaded if you delete all your user defined sets.
