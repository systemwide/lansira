Create custom sets of tabs.

For alpha/beta version installation please see: https://blog.hunter.io/install-chrome-extension-manually/ - a good 
concise guide to manually loading the extension as either an "unpacked extension" - if you download as a zip file and unzip, 
or as a .crx file.

A new set will be created from all the tabs in the currently active window.

Currently, In order to reset your tabs you must Reload the extension via the chrome://extensions/ page "Reload" option;
that will clear existing user sets and restore the default tab sets.
